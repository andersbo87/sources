.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm
is a script designed to update installed ports on a variety of UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems. Depending on which operating system you are running, the script calls one or several other tools (like apt, yum or zypper on Linux, pkg(1) on SunOS, freebsd-update(8) and pkg(8) on FreeBSD and softwareupdate(8) and port(1) on MacOS) and executes these tools. If the
.Fl p
or
.Fl P
option is used on FreeBSD,
.Nm
will first execute portsnap and then portmaster or portupgrade. 
.Nm
is an interactive tool (except for Linux and SunOS) which might ask several questions during the execution.
.Pp
If the user is running FreeBSD and does not use any of the options below,
.Nm
uses the FreeBSD version of pkg(8) when updating ports. HOWEVER, if both Portmaster(8) and Portupgrade(8) are installed, and the user did not use any of the options below,
.Nm
asks which tool (pkg(8), portmaster(8) or portupgrade(8))
.Nm
should use during the update process.
.Pp
.Sh OPTIONS
Depending on the operating system, one or more of the following options may be used:
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Fl v
Verbose mode. Valid on macOS, since MacPorts is a port tool that provides a verbose option. The
.Fl v
flag can also be used on FreeBSD if the user specifies the
.Fl P
(Portupgrade(1)) option. Portupgrade will be slightly more verbose than normal.
.It Fl p
Uses Portmaster(8), if installed, when updating installed ports. This option is only valid on FreeBSD.
.It Fl P
Uses Portupgrade(8), if installed, when updating installed ports. This option is only valid on FreeBSD.
.It Fl i
If the
.Fl p
or the
.Fl P
option is specified, tell Portmaster(8) or Portupgrade(1) to use be more interactive during execution. This option is useful if you only want to update certain ports. This option is only valid on FreeBSD.

.El
.Nm
on Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris does not accept any of the options listed above.

.Sh BUGS              \" Document known, unremedied bugs
If the user applies the
.Fl p
and
.Fl i
options and answers no to all questions,
.Nm
still asks to delete old packages and unused distfiles, as if an update executed.
.Sh HISTORY           \" Document history if command behaves in a unique manner
.Nm
first appeared on Mac OS X 10.8.3 and FreeBSD 9.1. It was then extended to support the latest versions of OpenBSD, NetBSD, Linux and Solaris as well as its open-source counterparts.
