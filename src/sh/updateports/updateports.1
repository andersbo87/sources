.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm
is a script designed to update installed ports on a variety of UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems.
Depending on which operating system you are running, the script calls one or several other tools (like apt-get on Linux, portsnap and then Portmaster or Portupgrade on FreeBSD) and executes those. 
.Nm
is an interactive script (except for Linux and SunOS) which might ask several questions during the execution.
