Linear regiression
tries to model the oytpyt variable (target) as a linear combination of the input variables (features).

Linear finds the line that best fits the data points
There are actually a number of different definition of best fit and therefore a number of …

Linear Regression in Azure ML
-----------------------------
-Ordinary Least Squares + en til

Logistic regression
-------------------
-In a classification problem, the output is binary rather than numeric.
-We can imagine doing a linear regression and then compressing the numeric output into a 0…1 range using the sigmoid (logit) function.

Logistic Regression in Azure ML
------------------------------
-Two-Class-Logistic regression
-Multiclass Logistic regression

k-Nearest-Neighbors - kNN
-------------------------
-This is also called instance-based learning because it doesn't even learn a
 single model
-The training process involves memorizing all the training data
-The voting can also be weithgtet among the K-neighbors based on their distance…


Effect of K
-----------
Larger K produces smoother boundary effetct and can reduce the impact of class label noise
But when K is too large, say K=n, we always predict the majority class

k-Nearest Neighbors in Azure ML
-------------------------------
Not available
It does not scale well to Big Data!
fordi modellen må "huske" all dataen.

Decicion trees
--------------
-Based on a tree of decicion nodes,
 the learning appraoach is to progressively divide the training data into
 buckets of as homogeneous member as possible thru the most discriminative
 dividing criteria possible.
-The training process stops when there is no significant gain in purity after
 further splitting the tree

Tree ensembles in Azure ML
--------------------------

-Decicion trees are prone to overfitting
-Common to use ensembles of decicion trees
--Bagging
---Each model is trained on a random subset of the data
---Averaged
--Boosting

Neural Network
-A Neural Network emulates the structure of a human brain as a network of
 neurons that are interconnected to each other
-Each neuron is (usually) equivalent to a logistic regression unit.

in azure:
-classification
--2-class
--multiclass
-regression
the default neural network is defined as follows:
the neural network has one hidden layer
…

Support Vector Machine

-A Support Vector Machine provides a binary classification mechanism based on
 finding a hyperplane between a set of samples with maximum separation.
-Assumes the data is linearly separable.

If the data distribution is non-linear, the trick is to transofrm the data to a higher dimension where the data…

Why "Support Vector"?
---------------------
-The closest data point are called the support vectors
-The are the points that defines the boundary between the classes.
